Slide 1: Introduction
Definition of FIDO Authentication: "FIDO stands for 'Fast IDentity Online', a set of technology-agnostic security specifications for strong authentication. FIDO is developed by the FIDO Alliance, a consortium formed to address the problems associated with the usage of passwords."
Importance of Secure Authentication: "In the modern digital era, secure authentication is paramount. It not only protects sensitive data but also ensures user trust. With the increasing number of online platforms, the need for a secure and hassle-free authentication method has never been more critical."
Brief History of FIDO Alliance: "The FIDO Alliance was formed in July 2012 to address the limitations of password-based authentication. It is a consortium of various industry leaders aiming to standardize and promote secure and easy-to-use authentication methods."

Slide 2: The Need for FIDO
Limitations of Password-Based Authentication: "Traditional password-based authentication methods are vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including phishing, brute force, and dictionary attacks. Moreover, they often lead to poor user experience due to password fatigue."
Password Fatigue: "Password fatigue is a phenomenon where users find it challenging to remember a multitude of passwords, leading to the reuse of passwords across different platforms, which is a significant security risk."
Security Breaches: "In recent years, there have been numerous high-profile security breaches where attackers exploited weak or stolen passwords to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data."

Slide 3: Overview of FIDO Authentication
FIDO UAF (Universal Authentication Framework): "The FIDO UAF protocol allows for passwordless multi-factor authentication. It enables users to authenticate using biometrics, mobile devices, or FIDO security keys, providing a more secure and user-friendly alternative to passwords."
FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd Factor): "FIDO U2F is a protocol that adds a strong second factor to user login. It requires users to present a physical device, such as a USB security key, during the authentication process, adding an extra layer of security."
FIDO2: "FIDO2 is the latest standard developed by the FIDO Alliance, aiming to make passwordless authentication ubiquitous. It comprises two components: WebAuthn and CTAP, which work together to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience."

Slide 4: FIDO2 - A Closer Look
WebAuthn (Web Authentication API):
Browser and Platform Support: "WebAuthn is supported by all major browsers and platforms, facilitating widespread adoption and integration into various online services."
Registration and Authentication Flow: "The registration and authentication flow in WebAuthn involves the creation of a unique key pair for each service, with the private key securely stored on the user's device and the public key registered with the service. During authentication, the service verifies a signature from the private key to authenticate the user."
CTAP (Client to Authenticator Protocol):
CTAP1/U2F: "CTAP1, also known as U2F, facilitates communication between the browser and external authenticators like USB security keys."
CTAP2: "CTAP2 extends the capabilities of CTAP1, allowing for more complex operations and supporting a wider range of authenticators, including mobile devices and biometric sensors."

Slide 5: Technical Architecture
Cryptographic Principles Behind FIDO: "FIDO relies on public-key cryptography to secure authentication transactions. During registration, a unique key pair is generated, with the private key securely stored on the user's device and the public key shared with the service. This ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be used for unauthorized access."
Authenticator Types: "In the FIDO ecosystem, there are two types of authenticators: roaming and platform authenticators. Roaming authenticators are removable devices that can work with multiple devices, while platform authenticators are built into the user's device, such as a fingerprint scanner or facial recognition system."
User Verification Methods: "FIDO supports various user verification methods, including PINs, biometrics, and passwords. These methods ensure that the person attempting to authenticate is the legitimate owner of the authenticator, adding an extra layer of security to the authentication process."

Slide 6: Security Features
Public Key Cryptography: "Public key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that involves a pair of keys â€“ a public key and a private key. In FIDO, the private key is stored securely on the user's device and is used to sign authentication requests, while the public key is registered with the service and used to verify the signatures."
Origin Bound Credentials: "Origin-bound credentials mean that the credentials created by FIDO are specific to the website's origin, preventing them from being used on a different website. This feature protects users from phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks."
Token Binding: "Token binding is a technique that secures tokens by binding them to the TLS layer, preventing token theft and replay attacks."
Protection Against Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: "FIDO employs channel binding and other techniques to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts and possibly alters the communication between the user and the service."

Slide 7: Privacy Considerations
Credential Isolation: "Credential isolation ensures that credentials are unique to each service, preventing tracking of users across different services. This feature protects user privacy by preventing cross-origin tracking."
Biometric Data Protection: "In FIDO, biometric data, if used, is stored locally on the user's device and never shared with the service, ensuring the protection of sensitive biometric data."
Cross-Origin Tracing Prevention: "FIDO protocols are designed to prevent cross-origin tracing, where a service could potentially track a user's activities across different websites, protecting user privacy."

Slide 8: Implementation Strategies
Integrating with Existing Systems: "Implementing FIDO in existing systems involves updating the authentication infrastructure to support FIDO protocols. This might include updating web applications to use the WebAuthn API and provisioning FIDO authenticators for users."
User Registration and Recovery Processes: "Organizations should develop user-friendly registration and recovery processes to facilitate the adoption of FIDO authentication. This includes setting up processes for user registration with FIDO authenticators and recovery procedures in case of lost or damaged authenticators."
Support for Multiple Authenticators: "FIDO supports the use of multiple authenticators, allowing users to register multiple devices and use any of them for authentication, providing flexibility and convenience."

Slide 9: Benefits of Adopting FIDO
Enhanced Security: "FIDO provides enhanced security by employing strong cryptographic techniques and protecting against various attacks, including phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks."
Improved User Experience: "FIDO offers a more user-friendly authentication experience by eliminating the need for passwords and allowing for convenient methods like biometrics."
Lower Support Costs: "By reducing the reliance on passwords, FIDO can potentially lower support costs associated with password resets and account recoveries."
